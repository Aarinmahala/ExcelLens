# MongoDB Integration Steps for Excel Analytics Platform

This document outlines the steps taken to integrate MongoDB with the Excel Analytics Platform.

## 1. Fixed Configuration Issues

### Updated Health Endpoint Configuration
- Modified `server/config/config.json` to properly structure the health endpoint configuration
- Changed from a simple string to a proper object with base and check properties
- Updated server.js to use the correct endpoint path with `getEndpointPath('health', 'check')`

### Removed Duplicate Code
- Fixed duplicate `connectDB` function declaration in server.js

### Updated MongoDB Connection Options
- Removed deprecated options from MongoDB connection configuration:
  - Removed `useNewUrlParser` (deprecated in MongoDB Driver 4.0.0)
  - Removed `useUnifiedTopology` (deprecated in MongoDB Driver 4.0.0)
  - Kept `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` for connection timeout control

## 2. Created MongoDB Models

### User Model (`server/models/User.js`)
- Created schema for user data
- Added fields: name, email, password, role, isActive, lastLogin, uploadCount, chartCount
- Implemented password hashing with bcrypt
- Added method for password comparison

### Upload Model (`server/models/Upload.js`)
- Created schema for upload data
- Added fields: fileName, originalName, fileSize, filePath, headers, rowCount, columnCount, status
- Implemented middleware to update user's upload count on save

### Chart Model (`server/models/Chart.js`)
- Created schema for chart data
- Added fields: title, description, type, xAxis, yAxis, configuration, isPublic, tags, downloadCount
- Implemented middleware to update user's chart count on save

## 3. Created MongoDB Utility Scripts

### Connection Check Script (`server/scripts/check-mongodb.js`)
- Created a script to check MongoDB connection status
- Displays connection details, available models, and collections
- Uses color-coded console output for better readability
- Implements retry logic for connection attempts

### Database Initialization Script (`server/scripts/init-db.js`)
- Created a script to initialize the database with sample data
- Adds sample users, uploads, and charts
- Sets up relationships between entities
- Implements safety check before clearing existing data

## 4. Updated Documentation

### MongoDB Setup Guide (`MONGODB_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
- Created a detailed guide for setting up MongoDB
- Includes installation instructions for Windows
- Provides steps for starting MongoDB service
- Explains how to connect using MongoDB Shell and Compass
- Includes troubleshooting tips for common issues

### Updated README.md
- Added MongoDB setup instructions
- Referenced the new MongoDB setup guide
- Updated login credentials
- Added information about MongoDB tools
- Explained the two application modes: MongoDB Mode and Mock Mode

## 5. Fallback Mode Implementation

- Ensured the application can run in mock mode when MongoDB is not available
- Implemented connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added clear console messages indicating the current mode

## Next Steps

1. **Install MongoDB**: Follow the MongoDB Setup Guide to install MongoDB
2. **Start MongoDB Service**: Ensure the MongoDB service is running
3. **Initialize Database**: Run the init-db.js script to set up sample data
4. **Test Application**: Start the application and verify it connects to MongoDB
5. **Implement Additional Features**: With MongoDB now integrated, implement additional features that require persistent storage
